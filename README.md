# Sortable Data Types
Git group exercise for INFO 4290.

Start this app on the command line by running `sort_data.py`.

## Sorting Integers
To sort an array of integers, the app calls the `sort_int()` function. This function will return an array of integers in ascending order. It will return -1 if any of the elements in the array are not integers.

## Sorting doubles
To sort an array of doubles, the app calls the `sort_doubles()` function. This function will return an array of doubles in ascending order. It will return -1 if any of the elements in the array are not doubles.

## Sorting Strings

To sort an array of strings, the app calls the `sort_string()` function. This function will return an array of strings where each string's characters are sorted in ascending order, and the modified list is then sorted alphabetically. It will return -1 if any of the elements in the array are not strings.

## Merging Arrays of Integers

To merge two arrays of integers and sort them in ascending order, the app calls the `merge_arrays()` function. This function takes two unsorted arrays as input, merges them, and returns a sorted array. It will return -1 if any of the elements in the input arrays are not integers.
