# Sortable Data Types
Git group exercise for INFO 4290.

Start this app on the command line by running `sort_data.py`.

## Sorting Integers
To sort an array of integers, the app calls the `sort_int()` function. This function will return an array of integers in ascending order. It will return -1 if any of the elements in the array are not integers.

## Sorting doubles
To sort an array of doubles, the app calls the `sort_doubles()` function. This function will return an array of doubles in ascending order. It will return -1 if any of the elements in the array are not doubles.

## Sorting Strings

This Python script defines a function sort_string that processes a list of input strings by sorting the characters within each string and then sorting the modified list alphabetically. The script prints the transformed list after processing.
